this is a nice solution for the weather project, the other solution used axios in front end to send the location
this solution used hidden form in front end to send the location wich was better than using axios, because axios
didn't refresh the page, so the weather infos didn't render in the post route, while when using forms, the submitted
form did refresh the page, so weather infos did render in the post route.

also using hidden form was a lot more simpler and easier then using axios in front end.
